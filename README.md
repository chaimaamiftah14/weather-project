Weather project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to my Weather Dashboard project! This is a web application that provides current weather information for any city worldwide. It allows users to search for a city and get real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

Features
- Real-Time Weather Data: Get the most up-to-date weather information for any city.
- Temperature Units: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Weather Icons: Visual representation of the current weather condition.
- Min/Max Temperature: Displays the minimum and maximum temperature for the day.
- Additional Weather Info: Includes real feel temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

Motivation
I was inspired to create this project to enhance my skills in front-end development and to  build a practical application that can be useful for everyday life. Weather is something we all experience daily, and having accurate and real-time information is crucial. This project is also a part of my portfolio for Holberton School, demonstrating my ability to build interactive and dynamic web applications.

Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the content.
- CSS: For styling the application.
- JavaScript: For fetching and displaying the weather data.
